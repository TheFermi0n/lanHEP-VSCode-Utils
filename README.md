# lanHEP VSCode Utils README

I have started learning about [microOMEGAs](https://lapth.cnrs.fr/micromegas/), which led me to [lanHEP](https://theory.sinp.msu.ru/~semenov/lanhep.html). Although beautiful, it seems to have no support for VSCode yet. Therefore, I am creating lanHEP language support for VSCode.

This extension provides syntax highlighting, indentation rules, and keyword support for the lanHEP language. It is designed for efficient editing and development of lanHEP models, with proper classification of keywords, operators, constants, and functions.

Created using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/).

## Features

Implemented so far:

- [x] lanHEP syntax highlighting.
- [x] Auto-completion support for brackets and strings (e.g., `{}`, `()`).
- [x] Support for comment shortcuts (`%`).

Planned Features:

- [ ] Intellisense for lanHEP, including keyword suggestions and error detection.
- [ ] Improvements to grammar for VSCode, such as better recognition of lanHEP constructs.

## Preview

Hereâ€™s an example of lanHEP syntax highlighting using this extension:
