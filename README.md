# lanHEP VSCode Utils README

I have started learning about [microOMEGAs](https://lapth.cnrs.fr/micromegas/), which lead me to [lanHEP](https://theory.sinp.msu.ru/~semenov/lanhep.html). Athough beautiful, it seems to have no support for VSCode yet. Therefore, I am trying to create lanHEP language support for VSCode.

Created using [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)

## Features

Implemented so far:

- [x] lanHEP syntax highlighting.
- [x] Auto-completion support for brackets and strings.
- [x] Support for comment shortcuts.

Future plan:

- [ ] Add intellisense for lanHEP.
- [ ] Imporve the grammar for VSCode.

## Installtion

This extension is published at the [VSCode marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thefermi0n.lanhep-vscode-utils).

## Known Issues

Most of the keywords may be missing or maybe messy, I will imporove it in next release.

## Release Notes

What is new can be found [here](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Bug report

Create an issue, I will respond as soon as possible.
